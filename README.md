This repository contains the source code and APK files for a set of Android applications I made during my time at university, using Android Studio.
Unfortunately the original repositories I used for development are no longer accessible, so the version history of these apps are unavailable.\
\
The first application is a simple MP3 player, with support for different playback speeds. The second is a movement tracking app, which uses Open Street Map and GPS to record statistics on the user's movement.\
